  The contact form on this page uses
  [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) to process
  submissions, and saves them in your Netlify account where you can optionally
  set up notifications. Each submission is passed through a spam filter and if
  flagged, will display a CAPTCHA challenge to the user.
